## Background Chess

#### A new terminal toy, from Trystin Flanigan

---
This program is a personal experiment for the purposes of learning the Rust programming language which is completely new to me, as well as learning about Mix/Max and Alpha Beta Pruning Algorithms. 
#####
The idea behind background chess is simple: 
- A simple bot capable of playing a game of chess
- A chess board that can be displayed in the terminal
- Set the bot against itself in chess as something to watch in the background
    - Optionally with the ability to play against a human player

This is a simply toy for your terminal if you are of the opinion that your computer doesn't have enough distractions. This has no practical purpose other than being mildly entertaining, and possibly showing off to others.

This README will be updated as the project evolves, and for the moment will serve as a basic outline of the project

### Proposed Features:
- Automatic play (AI vs. AI) or manual play (Human vs AI)
- Speed settings for automatic play
    - Because the idea of an unnecessarily fast game of chess running in your terminal entertains me, or slower settings if you'd like to actually be able to follow the game
- Score keeping for manual play
